--- Side note ---

Time is very valuable resource and we are trying to use it wisely - your time and our time. The reality of maintaining on open-source software is:

- Adding a new code and / or feature complicates the maintenance
- Most people disappear after contributing a feature, leaving the support to core maintainers

Given that, please don't be offended if your PR is rejected or significantly modified.
